# Task 1: In task 1 of Assignment 3, Using def function to create Factorial function in which it will multiply the value lower than given number by user, until 0!, and here 0! == 1. Means it will work like this;

                                                        result n * (n-1) * (n-1-1) * (n-1-1-1) 

                                                        until reaches Zero (0! == 1).

                                            
# Task 2: In task 2 of Assignment 3, Using Math module and integrate with def() function to make a program, in which user have to give number in this program and this program will give output of Log Value, Square root Value, Sine Value of that number. And to Make this code very easy to understand I use Asterisk (*) as wildcard to make every math module accessible.
